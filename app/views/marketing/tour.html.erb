        <h4>Getting Started with Water Cooler</h4>

        <p>Water Cooler is designed to make group conversations not so bad.   </p>

        <h4>The first time you log in</h4>

        <%= image_tag("help/help-1.png", :alt => "Water Cooler, Empty", :class => "help-screenshot") %>

        <p>When you first log into Water Cooler, you probably won’t have much in it (unless someone else added you to a lot of stuff, we’ll get to that later). </p>

        <h4>Talking to People</h4>

        <%= image_tag("help/help-1.png", :alt => "Water Cooler, Empty", :class => "help-screenshot") %>

        <p>Talking to people in Water Cooler is designed to feel smooth and easy, not unlike SMS or chatting in a messaging app (WhatsApp, Campfire, Facebook Messenger) </p>

        <%= image_tag("help/help-1.png", :alt => "Water Cooler, Empty", :class => "help-screenshot") %>

        <p>Sometimes, you need to send a big thought, maybe a paragraphs, more like an email.  The button next to the input box will open a bigger window for sending a longer reply.  </p>

        <%= image_tag("help/help-1.png", :alt => "Water Cooler, Empty", :class => "help-screenshot") %>

        <p>Water Cooler Conversations can go on for a long time, and shouldn’t break down into silliness like email threads often do.</p>

        <h4>Starting a Conversation</h4>

        <%= image_tag("help/help-1.png", :alt => "Water Cooler, Empty", :class => "help-screenshot") %>

        <p>A single conversation can be used almost indefintly, but at some point you'll realise you're having two conversations in the same thread.  At this point, you should create a conversation thread. </p>

        <h4>Escape the one large hopelessly unmanageable inbox</h4>

        <p>Water Cooler revamps how you keep people in the loop. We took the age-old organization system of folders and decided to throw in some magic. Everyone has their own folders for organizing conversations, but folders can also be shared with multiple people. Remember distribution lists? Remember trying to “clean out” your inbox? Remember reading email, never being sure whether it’s going to be an important one or not? </p>

        <h4>Fix mistakes and misinformation</h4>

        <p>Once a regular email has been sent with an error, it’s out there forever. You can send a follow up, or a clarification, or a correction, but those can get missed while the original email lives on—and if you later go looking for it, it’s pretty easy to find the incorrect message and not the correction. </p>

        <p>In Water Cooler you can delete and move messages after they’ve been sent so that the thread you and your coworkers are looking at has exactly what you need. And does Water Cooler keep track of what’s been deleted or moved with access to that deleted or moved content? Why, of course it does.</p>
